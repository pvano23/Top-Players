    <div class="dropdown-content">Position: WR (X) <br>
      Class: Class Of 2026<br>
      Team: South River High School (Edgewater, MD, US)<br> Height: 6’3” <br>Weight: 160
      Grade: D1 FCS level prospect (81.600)<br><br>
      PLAYER SUMMARY: McDuffie is my top overall player in his class and at his position. I firmly believe he can compete at the D1 FCS level and should draw serious interest from multiple programs at that tier. The only factor currently holding him back from FBS-level opportunities is his weight, but that’s an easily correctable aspect of his game. He’s an elite athlete with impressive length, and as a route runner, he executes sharp cuts and possesses a well-developed route tree. Additionally, he has the potential to contribute immediately as a return specialist and, by his second year, develop into a starting-caliber wide receiver for a program.

      Team: Liberty Center High School (Liberty Center, OH, US)<br> Height: 6’5”<br>Weight: 265<br>Grade: D1 FBS level prospect (83.370)<br><br>
      PLAYER SUMMARY: Wymer is currently my top prospect in the class of 2027. He possesses outstanding size and elite athletic traits that immediately stand out on film. While unverified, his reported 4.91 speed is highly impressive—and in my opinion, it translates well on tape. His relentless motor as an offensive lineman is a key differentiator, as he constantly pursues defenders and looks to dominate every rep. His combination of powerful leg drive and upper-body strength makes him a force to be reckoned with. He’s a player every program should have on their radar and one who should start earning offers quickly.

        Height: 5’10”<br>Weight: 205<br>
        Grade: D1 FCS level prospect (75.592)<br><br>
        PLAYER SUMMARY: Tiger is an incredibly talented running back, and I currently see him as the top running back in the class of 2026. I’ve graded him as a D1 FCS-level prospect and a priority full-ride D2 recruit. He’s an elite athlete with standout traits that make him a game- changer at his current level of play. With a compact build and an impressive overall skill set, he brings a lot to the table. He unofficially runs a 4.5-second 40-yard dash, which I believe is accurate based on his tape. He’s a player every coach should take a serious look at.

      <br>Grade: D1 FCS level prospect (74.814)<br><br>
      PLAYER SUMMARY: Wilson is my top-ranked offensive lineman in his class and one of the most talented prospects overall. He possesses rare size and athleticism, along with impressive technical skills in pass protection that demonstrate advanced abilities typically not seen in players of his age. He plays with a strong mean streak and takes pride in protecting his quarterback. Despite his height, he's able to stay low and fend off defenders trying to gain leverage. Overall, he’s one of the highest-rated offensive line prospects on my board.

    <br>Grade: D1 FCS/D2 level prospect (75.185)
    <br><br>PLAYER SUMMARY: Downey is one of the most well-rounded prospects I’ve scouted. He combines impressive physical traits with a refined skill set in both the run and pass game, making it extremely difficult for defenders to gain an edge on him. He carries his weight well, moves like a high-level athlete, and overall, there’s little to critique in his game. He stands out as one of the top offensive line prospects in Canada and should be on every coach’s radar. Any concerns about the level of competition can easily be addressed by seeing him perform at a camp—he’s that good.

    PLAYER SUMMARY: Wickett is easily the best quarterback I’ve seen from both the 2026 and 2027 classes, making him an incredibly exciting prospect. I truly believe he possesses an elite arm along with other traits that make him stand out. As an athlete, I think he could even succeed at the next level as a wide receiver, where his twin brother also plays and has found a lot of success. On tape, he showcases skills that many young players never develop, and I believe his arm is already ready for senior varsity competition. With such a high ceiling, Wickett is a player I’m genuinely excited about. He should be seriously considered by every program in Canada and beyond.

    <br>Class: 2026<br>Team: Hammarskjold<br>Height: 6”<br>Weight: 185
    <br>Grade: D1 FCS level prospect (72.545)<br><br>
    PLAYER SUMMARY: Shott is a highly talented wide receiver who faces the challenge of being located in Thunder Bay, far from many U Sports programs, which makes it harder for him to get exposure. Unfortunately, his team had a winless season, and in my opinion, he was held back by poor quarterback play and a run-heavy offense with limited talent around him, making it difficult for him to fully showcase his skills. Despite these challenges, he is an elite-level athlete with natural ability, and he excels academically, maintaining an average above 90% in all his studies. With his size, athleticism, and overall potential, ShoB is a wide receiver that every Canadian (and some U.S.) schools should be aware of and have on their radar.

    <br>Grade: D1 FCS level prospect (70.037)
    <br><br>PLAYER SUMMARY: Nosa is one of the top prospects in the 2027 class and the best running back in his group. His natural ability, physical tools, and impressive ball carrier moves make him stand out. While he lacks true breakaway speed and projects as a 4.7-second 40-yard dash runner, he’s more quick than fast, which suits his short-yardage style. Many elite backs run in the 4.5s, so his long speed isn’t a major concern. He still has room to grow physically, and playing at American Prep will expose him to stronger competition, helping him elevate his game even further.

    PLAYER SUMMARY: Nesbit is an exceptionally talented athlete with speed that is definitely next-level worthy. It’s also worth mentioning that he has experience playing both ways as a defensive back. Given his athletic traits, I’d be interested to see him play on the other side of the ball as well. He’s consistently been the fastest player on the field, often outrunning anyone lined up against him. I’d even be curious to see him at wide receiver, as he’s a player who thrives with the ball in his hands and can make plays. Overall, I really like him as a prospect and believe he’s deserving of offers at the D1 FCS level, as well as D2 opportunities.

    PLAYER SUMMARY: Odenyo is a highly talented receiver who deserves consideration at all levels of play. He’s a physical playmaker who can power through defenders while also displaying the agility to make them miss in open space. With his skill set, he could thrive as a bigger slot receiver, as he’s dangerous with the ball in his hands and capable of creating big plays on the ground. Additionally, he excels in contested catch situations, making him a major red-zone threat with multiple ways to impact a defense. His versatility makes him a player who should rarely come off the field, especially given his effectiveness as a run blocker. Despite his already impressive skill set, he’s still young with significant upside. I believe he has the potential to develop into the top wide receiver in Canada for his class.
